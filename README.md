# Makefiles Lecture
### Date Created: 2024-03-04

Thanks to Daniel Chen and the DSCI 310 class at UBC for this lecture and information!

## Main Ideas

Here are the main things we went over in this class:

* How to transfer script information to be used in the makefile, using the `docopt` library
* Creating a Makefile, such that it runs
* How to make a report with the saved outputs integrated
* Creating a website in the root folder of your repository
* etc.

##### Other notes:

* If github pages is set to /root, it will only look for index.html
  * It can also be set to /docs, and then you don't need the exact naming
  * There is one other way, where you have to make another specific file type
* Use `git diff` to see what changed if you are confused
